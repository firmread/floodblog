				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The direction of my project has just been clarified by the most terrify news in recent years in Thailand. A few days ago, a lower class old man, Ampon Tangnoppakul, 61 (aka Ar Kong, grandpa in Chinese) has been called guilty for sending 4 SMS to an official working for Ex-Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. Those 4 SMSs have a contents that criticism on royal family which is against the article 112 law (aka lese majeste). He been sentenced by the court to be jailed 5 years for each crime, that means 20 years for 4 SMS.</p>
<p>The lese majeste law has been an issue to debate in Thailand for a long time. It&#8217;s obviously that this law has its flaw, as it&#8217;s been used as weapon to discredit political opponent. Which is abuse this law and been understand by intellectuals both on conservative royalist side and progressive side that this law need to change. Yet, the friction in the society still strong, the passionate feeling about monarchy has rooted to their heart content, which somehow make this blind spot keep on its existence.</p>
<p>Even before I came here, I was one of more than <a href="http://www.thaipoetsociety.com/index.php?topic=3668.0">300 writers</a> in Thailand signed a <a href="http://www.prachatai.com/english/node/2589">petition</a> urging the amendment of the Lese Majeste Law which is being used to suppress freedom of expression in the country. Which our movement has no harm or political takes on the statement at all. But we just fight for free speech which should be our rights in democracy country. So I decided to continue on this approach and my takes on the project, using flooding as scenario, but to reflect a worse problem that been hiding on this land for decades and just rise to be able to see again after the flood has gone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog is the documentation of Firm Tharit Tothong final project for Major Studio &#8211; Interface class in MFA Design and Technology at Parsons the New School For Design in Fall 2011. Since it&#8217;s the first time Firm have left his home country for such a long time, a strange relationship between he and the emerging of social networks in everyday life gets to the point that his experience seems to be surreal, especially when the major flooding happens in Central Thailand. Everyone he known in Thailand is facing this catastrophe, but for him it feels like just another narrative happens in the computer screen.</p>
<p>Through this project, Firm trying to express his awkward experience from his own perspective and skill sets he learnt from this semester and synthesize it into an installation &#8211; the work that he always wanted to do.</p>
