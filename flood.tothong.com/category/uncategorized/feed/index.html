				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>from:<br />
<a href="http://news.voicetv.co.th/in-english/25006.html"> http://news.voicetv.co.th/in-english/25006.html</a></p>
<h1>US Raises Concerns Over &#8221;Akong&#8221; Case<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #333333; font-weight: 300;"> </span></h1>
<p>The United States has considered Thailand&#8217;s recent court rulings as &#8221;inconsistent with international standards of freedom of expression.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Thai court sentenced Ampon &#8221;Akong&#8221; Tangnoppakul to 20 years in prison for sending four short messages on the cell phone deemed offensive to the country&#8217;s High Institution, reported The Washington Post on Tuesday.</p>
<p>US State Department spokeswoman for East Asia Darragh Paradiso said the US has utmost respect for the Thai monarchy but has been &#8220;troubled by recent prosecutions and court decisions that are not consistent with international standards of freedom of expression.&#8221;</p>
<p>The European Union also has expressed concerns over Ampon&#8217;s court sentencing which was viewed as one of Thailand&#8217;s most severe cases involving lese majeste charges.</p>
<p>The 61-year-old Ampon denied he had sent the text messages, saying he was not accustomed to using varied functions on his cell phone and did not know the recipient of the messages, a personal secretary of former premier Abhisit Vejjajiva.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Thai-born American national Joe Gordon is scheduled shortly to be verdicted by court for translating excerpts of a banned biography of His Majesty the King of Thailand entitled &#8221;The King Never Smiles&#8221; and posting them online.</p>
<p>Also known as Lerpong Wichaikammat, the 54-year-old Gordon has pleaded guilty to the lese majeste charges perpetrated several years ago while in Colorado. He could be sentenced to 15 years in jail for such offenses. He was arrested in Nakorn Ratchasima after he had returned home earlier this year and denied release on bail.</p>
<p>The US Department of State expressed disappointment at the Thai prosecutors&#8217; decision to lodge  the lese majeste lawsuit against Gordon, who is concurrently a US citizen and Thai national. US embassy officials based in Bangkok had insisted in vain the Thai authorities ensure Gordon&#8217;s freedom of expression would be respected and that he would receive fair treatment.</p>
<p>Thai authorities have banned Thailand&#8217;s access to the US-based website of Yale University Press, which published the book in 2006.<strong> </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to Katie, who pointing out interesting relationship between flooding and Rube Goldberg Machine. The more I think about it the more I like it. I had a brief research on the idea of Rube Goldberg Machine and found that it has really interesting background. How Rube Goldberg the cartoonist inspired people with that ridiculously complex system to achieve simple task. Which in the sense, is really good metaphor to critic about Thai politic in flooding situation without being too explicit. Because in term of interface of Thai politic, It seems like the flood has triggered so many crazy things in Thailand. And to conceptualize it into input/output of many seems-to-be-unrelated stuffs sounds perfect combination for the intention I have at the start.</p>
